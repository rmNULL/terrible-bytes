# Terrible-Bytes
Convey size information in human friendly format to your js runtime.
Bid adieu to those numbers without units.

# Simple to use, Easy to Understand
```javascript
import {b} from 'terrible-bytes';

// convert 8 Megabytes into bytes
const uploadLimitBytes = b`8MB`
const someotherthingBytes = b`5G` + b`640M` // approx. 5.64Gigabytes
const altsomeotherthingBytes = b`5.64G`       // you could have also specified it this way
```

Ye get rid of those KB, MB, GB constants and please let's just stop doing `size=8*MB`

# Supported Units
Only S.I and ISO/IEC standard unit prefixes are allowed.
In the case of K we make an exception and treat it as kilobyte.
However, a warning is consoled when K is provided as the unit.

The ISO and IEC table are given below for the sake of convenience,
Apart from the values in the table, 'B' can exist to mean byte.
Here are some valid strings, to give an example
e.g:
`` b`4` ``
`` b`4B`  ``
`` b`4M` ``
`` b`4MB` ``
``b`4Mi` ``
``b`4MiB` ``

# Installation

```shell
npm install terrible-bytes
```


# What Does this have that other libs don't?
1) I haven't seen the use of tagged template for specifying
sizes before(its probably because i haven't looked hard enough)
2) Does this question have to be strawmaned every time someone reinvents
the wheel? :|
3) Idk, go use the other lib if you like that better, no one has the
authority to stop you from doing that champ. May this ðŸª„ magic wand help in
your journey.
